    <p>Peer 1 on 1 is a non-profit organization which targets autism and other developmental disorders by allowing
        autistic children from ages five to eighteen with opportunities to interact with our teen volunteers.
        Activities include watching movies together, going on hiking trips, playing sports together, and attending
        major events against autism, and much more (refer to our "Activities" page and our "Upcoming Activities" page).
    </p>
    <p>Peer 1 on 1 not only seeks to benefit autistic children, but to also benefit our volunteers. We accept teen
        volunteers over the age of 11 and adult volunteers. Teen volunteers would benefit through an increased knowledge of
        autism, service hours, and the getting to know autistic peers. Adult volunteers would volunteer the same way as teen
        volunteers but would also be able to provide supervision. We operate in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas of
        Southern California in the United States. However, if you do not live near Los Angeles or Orange County and are
        interested in volunteering or would like to set up your own chapter of Peer1on1 in your area, please contact us. If
        a club, group, or organization would like to get involved as a whole with Peer1on1, please contact us through the
        “Contact Us” page. Such ways for different groups to get involved include hosting joint activities or events with
        Peer1on1 or allowing members of high school clubs to receive hours for volunteering in Peer1on1.
